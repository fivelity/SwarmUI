Core Identity & Vision:
Project Name: ReactiveSwarm
Objective: 100% feature parity with SwarmUI in a modern, real-time Vite environment.
Design Aesthetic: Modern Dark 2.0. Deep charcoal/black backgrounds (#09090b), glassmorphism layers, and bento-style telemetry headers.

Technology Constraints (2026 Stack):
Frontend: React 19+ (strict), TypeScript 5.6+, and Tailwind CSS v4.1+.
State Management: Zustand with a modular slice architecture (`useGenerationStore`, `useBackendStore`, `useModelStore`).
UI Library: Shadcn UI (Latest) and Lucide React icons. Avoid other icon sets unless requested.
State Rules: Never use prop-drilling or large React Contexts for real-time generation data. Subscriptions must be fine-grained to prevent re-render lag.

Modular & Resizable Layout:
Panel System: Use `react-resizable-panels` for a 3-column setup. Both sidebars must be resizable via drag handles and collapsible via arrow toggles. Persist states in useLayoutStore and localStorage.
UI Slots: Build a modular "Slot" system allowing users to rearrange the "Main Canvas," "Model Browser," and "Gallery." Users should be able to toggle "Layout Modification Mode" to swap component positions.

Advanced Parameter Engine (Left Sidebar):
Sortable UI: Implement a "Pick and Place" system using `@dnd-kit/sortable` for all parameter groups (Sampling, Seed, etc.). Users can drag groups to change their vertical order.
Searchable Params: Include a real-time filter at the top of the sidebar to find specific parameters within the groups.
Display Advanced Parameters: Implement a toggle switch for the 'Display Advanced Parameters' boolean, to unhide the complete list of available parameters.

Feature Parity Guidelines:
Real-time: Must handle live binary/base64 image streams via WebSocket.
Prompt Engine: Implement a real-time syntax parser for:
`<wildcard:path>` and `<random:a,b>`.
`<alt:cat,dog>` (alternating every step).
`<param[cfgscale]:5>` (embedded parameter overrides).
ComfyUI Sync: A dedicated "Workflow" tab/page with an iframe to `/ComfyBackendDirect/`. Use `postMessage` for bi-directional state syncing (injecting seeds/prompts from the React UI into the node workflow).
Model Browser: Must support folder-tree navigation and metadata display.
Grid Generator: A specialized UI for multi-axis parameter testing with dynamic axis reorganization.
Image Editor: Integrated canvas for inpainting and masking with brush size and blur controls.

Performance & Theming;
React 19 Transitions: Wrap all sidebar slider updates in `startTransition` to ensure the main UI never stutters.
Theme Service: All UI tokens (colors, blur, spacing) must be native CSS variables in the Tailwind 4 theme.
Import/Export: A "Theme Manager" that exports current variables as a .json blob and allows users to upload theme files to instantly re-skin the entire dashboard.
ComfyUI Bridge: A persistent WebSocket connection to the Swarm backend that streams Node-level progress even when the user is in the "Simple" tab.
